#ec2 #storage
- when we need a high performance hardware disk
- attached physically
- better I/O performance
- ephemeral (temporary)
- **Good** for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content for short-term storage
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails
- Backups and replication are user's responsibility
